# grid
Hi,there its just a gridcardview
There are are 5 main files:
1)activity_main.xml->For  layout purpose and gui

2)card_view_item_grid.xml->For setting configuration of images and text in Gui of user

3)Mainactivity.kt->Logic to call required packages and setting our images in drawable folder
,one additional functionality of "showing name of image by clicking on it" is added.

4)CarItem package->Used for creating secondary constructor for images and their names or you can say is's if you want.

5)CarAdapters package->Basically it takes values of images,items,names and store it in arraylist and places it into correct placeholder
